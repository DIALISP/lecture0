                    <p>CIFA is the acronym for "Calculatorul Institutului de Fizică Atomică" 
                    (English: Computer of Atomic Physics Institute). CIFA-1, the first 
                    Romanian computer, was built in 1957 and made Romania the second socialist 
                    country (after USSR) and eighth overall to build an electronic computer. </p>
                    <p>The logic designs for CIFA-1 started in 1953, at the Academy Physics Institute 
                    in Măgurele, with Victor Toma as the head of the project.[1][3] It was presented 
                    at the International Symposium in Dresden in 1955, and the prototype, which used 
                    1500 vacuum tubes, a cylindrical magnet memory and machine code programming, 
                    was finished in 1957. Its size was that of three wardrobes, it had a paper tape 
                    input and a typewriter output and was able of solving 50 operations per second. </p>
