                    <h2>The beginning</h2>                   
                    <p>Born in the early '80's in, what was at the time, comunist Romania, John
                    (Ion) showed from the begining an afinity for computers. At 3 months old he could 
                    already bang on computer keys and could speak binary, using
                    "gaga" as 0 and "gugu" as 1. Clearly a genius</p>
                    <p>At 6 years old he saw his first game, called Chronos, on a ZXSpectrum clone, made in
                    Romania, called HC85 and he liked it.</p>
                    <p>He dreamed of one day building his own games but when he saw that to draw a few circles
                    on the screen you have to write a whole page of text he found it very stupid and did what
                    every genius would, give up.</p>

                    <h2>The future</h2>                   
                     <p>Fast forward 35 glorious years and and after meeting with great succes against the aliens
                    in Duke Nukem 3d and Half Life, he acomplished everything he planned to do. Now searching for 
                    a new project he needed something grand that would fit his genius, first he wanted to 
                    cure cancer, then to stop world hunger, then to kick Chuck Norris ass... a third time, but all
                    of that felt so easy and boring, and then it hit him, coding, an app, the app that will put 
                    Jobs, Zuckerberg, Musk and the Russian guy from Google to shame. This is his
                    mission, and he will do it in 6 months. </p>
