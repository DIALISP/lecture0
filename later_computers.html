                    <p>The Felix M18 business computers family was composed of three members, 
                    the M18, M18B and M118GS. They were designed and manufactured in Romania 
                    between 1975 and 1981, using the Intel 8080 processor. </p>
                    <p>The M18 series had a modular structure composed of master and slave modules, 
                    interconnected through a common bus. The MASTER-UCB module contained the 8080 
                    microprocessor, an 8 KB EPROM memory, the 8224 clock circuit, the 8228 local bus 
                    command circuit and the 8259 interrupt circuit. </p>

                    <p>The Felix PC was originally designed at the Polytechnical Institute 
                    of Bucharest, as a laboratory system, between 1983 and 1984. It was then 
                    taken by ICE Felix for mass production from 1985 to 1990. Latest versions 
                    were close to the IBM PC features: 4.77 MHz 8088, 256 to 640 KB of RAM 
                    and an optional 20 MB hard disk. </p>

                    <p>The Romanian computers HC family (HC 85, HC 85+, HC 88, HC 90, 
                    HC 91 and HC 2000) were clones of Sinclair ZX Spectrum that were produced 
                    at ICE Felix from 1985 to 1994. HC 85 was first designed at Institutul 
                    Politehnic Bucure»ôti by Prof. Dr. Ing. Adrian Petrescu (in laboratory), 
                    then redesigned at ICE Felix (in order to be produced at industrial scale). 
                    Their operating system was a BASIC interpreter.  </p>
